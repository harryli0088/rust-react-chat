### Watch files to rebuild when you save
You can download ```cargo-watch``` run cargo commands every time you save a file (instead of manually shutting down the server then re-running ```cargo run```). To install, run
```
cargo install cargo-watch
```

Then you can run this command to watch and run your files:
```
cargo watch -x 'run'
```
